# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This page was used to practice the lessons learned in the modules. In this page we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There were many bugs found along the way, but each issue was fixed during debugging. Gitbash was used to create different versions during each stage. Different branches were made and had to be push, pulled, and merged with the cloud-based host, GitHub.
